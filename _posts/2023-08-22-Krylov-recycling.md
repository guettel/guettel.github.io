# Krylov subspace recycling with randomized sketching

[Liam Burke](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/people/burke/) and I have just released a new preprint <https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02290>

This is about combining Krylov subspace recycling and randomized sketching for the approximation of sequences of matrix functions, including solving slowly varying linear systems of equations.
